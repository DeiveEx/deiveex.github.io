Hi everyone!

I'm here today to announce a small game I've been working on my free time: It's called [**Waving Around**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2770500/Waving_Around/)!
It's a multiplayer arena game where you stomp the ground to create energy waves to damage your oponents. You can play it online or offline with your friends.

Check out the trailer below:

I've started working on this game a while ago, the main reason for it was to have something released on my name, so I decided to make something relatively simple. Honestly, I've been working on it way longer than what I'd like to, but I'm finally almost finished!

If you liked it, don't forget to [wishlist it on Steam right now](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2770500/Waving_Around/)!
