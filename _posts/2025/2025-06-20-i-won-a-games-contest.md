Wow! the results are just out and I can't believe my eyes: my game concept **Growing Horrors** is one of the winners of the [Rising Tide Challenge by Blue Ocean Games](https://blueoceangames.com/challenge/winners)!!!

I think I never won anything on that scale (there was over 1000 entries!), and there was so many amazing games in the competition! I still can't believe I was actually selected! I'm so excited!

Congratulations to all the winners, and to Blue Ocean Games for creating such an oportunity to small devs like me!
