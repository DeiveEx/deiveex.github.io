excerpt: Starting a Devlog!
---

Hi everyone!

I'm here today to announce that I'v decided to start a Devlog Series for my game **Growing Horrors**! I've been wanting to do a Devlog Series for a while as a way to document my progress, but never really got enough willpower to do it. Well, I'm hoping to change that today!

For this Devlog Zero I want to talk a bit about how the idea came to be, and what are my plans for it. Then, without further ado:

# The Idea

Well, I've been creating games for almost a decade now but I've mostly just created small prototypes of projects for clients, but with the years passing by faster and faster, I've started to question myself what I really want to do with my life: Do I really want to create games for other people until I die?

Well, the answer is *"No"* and, in fact, it was always *"No"*. But life gets in the way and prioties change, so making games for myself was always more of a hobby and a way for me to improve more than anything. But around 4 years ago, a collegue of mine release their game, called [Unsighted](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062110/UNSIGHTED/). I actually saw and played the alpha version of it, and seeing it not only become a pretty good game, but also be pretty successfull game was really cool, but also made me a bit jealous. Made me start to think "Why am I not doing that?".

Well, as you might've noticed, it's been 4 years since then and I still haven't released anything. I'm actually really close to releasing my first game, [Waving Around](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2770500/Waving_Around/), but that was a (not so) small project I decided to create more for portfolio than anything else. But since that day, I have been thinking about what kind of game I wanted to make, and I've been writting all my ideas down, even if they don't look very good. Who knows, maybe one day I'll get an epiphany and get a good idea.

And that was exactly what happened. On a random day around 1 year ago I was eating a burguer with my girlfriend and talking about random stuff, and one of topics was about me wanting to get a publisher to support the creating of a game. But to get that, I need have a good game, and although I had a good prototype for another idea at the time, it didn't feel like it was THE game (I still want to revist it one day, though). At that point, for some reason I don't remember now she mentioned [Stardew Valley](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/), a game both of us have hundreds of hours of playtime (she has way more than me), and at the same time, I remembered a video I've watched a while ago saying that every developer should develop an Horror Game at least once. Now, I'm not really a fan of horror games, but at that point, it clicked: **what about a Farming... Horror game?**

I like Stardew Valley, and while I haven't played a lot of horror games, there's were a few that I really liked, like [Darkwood](https://store.steampowered.com/app/274520/Darkwood/). A mix of the two sounded pretty cool, and I have never seen anything like that before. From that point on, the conversation just started to flow, with more and more ideas forming. And that's how **Growing Horrors** (a pun of the idea of growing plants, and how the horrors around you gets more and more frequent with each passing day) came to be.

# My Expectations

Now, while a **Farming and Horror** game is really not something very commom, I was not the first to think about it. Other games with these themes already exists (like [We Harvest Shadows](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1559720/We_Harvest_Shadows/) or [Welcome to Elderfield](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3195440/Welcome_to_Elderfield/)), but none of them looks like what I had in my head, which is something like **Darkwood with Farming**. The closest (and only) game that get pretty close to this is [Grave Seasons](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255110/Grave_Seasons/), but even that, they lend more to the "cute" side of things, and the farming aspect seems secondary, with the story being the primary focus (at least that's the idea I get from the trailer). That's not what I want, I want heavy, dark graphics, I want tension, I want the player to question things and be scared of even leaving their house.

So, I still think I have a pretty unique idea in my hands, one that no one ever made *in this way*. As a bonus, it also seems like this is a very unexplored market, and if the number of wishlists on the games I mentioned before is anything to go by, it seems like there's a demand for something on this weird mix of genres.

Also, if you didn't know, I've decided to put this idea to test a couple of months ago when I received an email about a competition called Rising Tide Challenge, and with nothing but the idea and a few friends to help me make a trailer, I actually ended up [being one of the winners!](/posts/2025-06-20-i-won-a-games-contest) So, this felt like confirmation that this idea has potential.

# Where we are today

Reality hit hard when we decided to make the Pitch for the game: to achieve the game I'm envisioning, the scope is pretty big, and if we (me and my friends who helped with the trailer) are gonna look for investment, we'll need a decent amount of money. Blue Ocean Games (or BOG, the ones responsible for organizing the Rising Tide Challenge) was offering a max of 300.000 USD, which is a bit shorter than our ideal investment. Also, since they're doing high risk investment, their contract has some terms that didn't sound very great. It puts a lot of responsabilities on the back of the developers, and there's some terms that sounds more like chains than a partnership.

So, ultimately we've decided to take advantage of the fact that BOG didn't give us a deadline for the pitch and first try to pitch the game to other publishers to see if we can get a better deal. If all else fails, we can try BOG and see how it goes.

The "bad" thing about this approach is that while BOG only required a trailer, if we want to pitch to a publisher, we need to actually have something playable. So that's what we've been doing these says. Or, well, that's what I've been doings these days.

You see, this game is my idea. My friends helped me create the RTC trailer because I asked them, and it was kinda of a "Month-long Game Jam Project" for us. We didn't really think we would win. But, while my friends do believe the game has some potential, we haven't created it together. I have dozens of pages with ideas for this game, which kinda makes me the "idea guy", and no one likes the idea guy (unless they can pay you good money, which I don't have). Being all adults with busy lives, it's hard to invest your free time on something you don't love, specially when each of us have our own ideas.

So, that brings us to today: my current objective is to make a playable prototype of the game, not only for the publishers, but also to try and show my friends this idea is worth their time. And, in all honesty, as a way to prove to myself this game is not only good on paper. I really do believe this game has great potential, but I'm really scared I won't be able to bring all this potential out. I know I can't do it alone.

# Final Thoughts

Well, there you go, my first Devlog ever. I probably ranted a lot, and there was basically no dev-related stuff, but that's why this is chapter zero haha

I'm hoping to write one of these at least once a month, but we'll see. On the next one I'll try to get a bit more technical and show what I've actually been working on. Spoiler alert: very early stuff. But hopefully, by documenting the process here, it'll help me (and you, dear reader) see how the game is progressings.

Well, I don't know what else to say so... See you on the next entry!
