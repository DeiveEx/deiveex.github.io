Wow, my game concept **Growing Horrors** is one of the winners of the [Rising Tide Challenge by Blue Ocean Games](https://blueoceangames.com/challenge/winners)!!!

I'm so excited! I think I never won anything on that scale (there was over 1000 entries!), and there was so many amazing games in the competition! I still can't believe I was actually selected!

Congratulations to all the winners, and to Blue Ocean Games for creating such an oportunity to small devs like me!

Now, time to start working on my pitch deck...
