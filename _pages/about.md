I'm a programmer with a strong focus on Game Development. My main tool of trade is Unity/C#, but I also have experience working with other engines and languages, like Unreal/C++ and Javascript.

I’ve been doing professional work in Game Development for around 5 years, but I’ve previously worked with VR and Mobile  App development as well.

I also like to participate in Game Jams from time to time and try my hand at Shader and VFX development, which gives me a pretty solid understanding of other areas like 3D modeling/animation and Tech Art.
